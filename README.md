# Welcome to Green Light!

If you’re like me, you have trouble keeping a garden because you often forget to water your plants. To handle this, I created Green Light, an app designed to not only track plants in a user’s garden, but also set reminders for various tasks.

If you're authenticated, you'll have access to your profile, where you can add the plants you wish tracked. Each plant comes with the ability to set task reminders, quantities, and the option to mark a task as complete.
